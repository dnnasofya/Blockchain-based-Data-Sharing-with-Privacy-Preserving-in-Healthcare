# Blockchain-based-Data-Sharing-with-Privacy-Preserving-in-Healthcare

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of a blockchain-based data sharing system that ensures secure exchange of patient information while preserving privacy. This project involves the development of a decentralized application (DApp) utilizing Ethereum blockchain and smart contracta for secure data storage and access management.

## Features
- **Decentralized Storage**: Uses Ethereum blockchain to store patient information, ensuring data is tamper-proof.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates access permissions and transaction process.
- **Patient Control**: Allow patients with complete authority over their health data to grant or revoke access to doctors.

## Prerequisites
- **Ganache** : For local blockchain testing.
- **MetaMask** : For managing Ethereum wallets and transactions.
- **Node.js and Truffle** : Framework for smart contract deployment.

## Setup

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites
1. Download and install **Ganache** for local blockchain testing.
2. Install **MetaMask** browser extension.
3. Download and install **Node.js**.
4. Install **Truffle** : `npm install -g truffle`

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository:
`git clone <repository-url>`

### Step 3: Install Dependencies:
`npm install`

### Step 4: Setup Local Blockchain
Configure the 'truffle-config.js' file to connect to the local blockchain provided by Ganache.
